For those of you who don't know. I'm selling my moto on eBay. The auction ends today, so for the three people who read my blog it will probably already be too late. Well, they probably know that I'm selling it already anyway.

Today, I also started putting up a lot of baseball card stuff I have. Today I posted my eTopps cards from 2001 / 2002 as well as several un-opened boxes of cards from 1984, 1990, 1991, 2001 & 2002.

All of my items are available <a href="http://search.ebay.com/_W0QQsassZedwardamQQhtZ-1">here</a>.
