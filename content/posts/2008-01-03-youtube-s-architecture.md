Check out <a href="http://highscalability.com/youtube-architecture">this information</a> about Youtube's architecture. It's not super interesting, but I like the "Lessons Learned" part.

Here is the <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6304964351441328559">original video</a> this summary was taken from. I have yet to watch the entire video, but I hope to do that once some things are wrapped up at work.
