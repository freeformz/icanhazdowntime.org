title: My Security Scale
published: true

I've been doing a bunch of work on some systems for The U.S. House of Representatives and their security measures are a pretty stringent. So I finally wanted to write down my security scale.

My scale carries a 1 to 100 rating. The lower the number the less secure the system is. At this point I only have two ratings on which to go by:

1 = A newly installed system plugged into the internet, without a firewall in front of it, running the original version of Windows XP.

100 = Any system, unplugged, powered off, locked in a lead lined safe, which is then buried inside of a 1,000,000 cu ft of reinforced cement and everyone who worked on the safe, the system and the burial executed.

Where does your system stand?
