Well, it looks like I have a buyer for my 06 Victory Vegas!

Now ... I just need to decide which of the two Triumphs I want... <a href="http://www.triumph.co.uk/usa/4506.aspx">Tiger</a> or <a href="http://www.triumph.co.uk/usa/4517.aspx">Sprint ST</a>

Most of my thoughts have been laid out in a <a href="http://www.t595.net/messageboard/thread.asp?thread=49075">thread</a> I started on T595, a Triumph enthusiasts site.
At the moment I am leaning towards the Sprint ST for the following reasons:
<ol>
	<li>Comes with bags standard (i.e. will cost less for me since ... I need bags)</li>
	<li>Decent ergonomics (although not as good as the Tiger's)</li>
	<li>Great wind protection (which is also a drawback sometimes too .. that full fairing has to catch a lot of wind)</li>
	<li>Hauls ass. Not that the Tiger doesn't ... The Sprint is just snappier IMHO.</li>
	<li>Known design. The Tiger 1050 is a NEW bike. Give it a year or so to shake out. Mind you it seems like it's totally solid, so this is probably me being paranoid.</li>
</ol>
I figure if I end up disliking this bike after a year I can trade it in for a new ... or used Tiger 1050 next year. Just need to not spend so much on upgrades. Which I figure will be easier. The only things I can think of upgrading on the bike are the grips (to heated) and exhaust (to one that breathes better). I understand there is a touring windscreen, but I don't remember disliking the stock one when I rode it.

All of those mods I would want to make to the Tiger anyway ... plus I need to buy bags.

I am hoping this will actually be the last personal motorcycle purchase for me for the next few years. Sans ... starting a motorcycle related business that is.....
