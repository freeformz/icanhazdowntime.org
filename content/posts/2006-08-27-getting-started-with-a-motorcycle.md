Here's what's been going on ...

Last Thursday I bought a used 1996 Suzuki Intruder VS1400 with 7200 miles on it. The bike looks like it's in pretty good shape.

I had trouble getting the bike in gear at the dealer so I had them deliver it to my house on Friday.

Friday morning it rained, but <a href="http://www.cruisin66cycles.com/" target="_blank">they</a> still drove the bike out and delivered it.

Friday night I got home, with about 15 minutes of daylight left and couldn't get the bike started. It looks like I may have flooded the engine, then wore down the battery by trying to start it too much.

Saturday morning I tried starting it again, no love. So I went to the local bike shop and got a Battery Tender Jr. I hooked it up until about 6:00 PM. The bike started right up. I got to drive it around for about 2 hours before I had to go to work and it got dark. When I got home Saturday night I hooked the charger back up.

Sunday morning the charger was still charging (this battery clearly needed a charge). But on Sunday morning after my friend <a href="http://peroro.net" target="_blank">Patrick</a> left the power went out for a second. I later checked the battery charger and it wasn't working anymore (no green or red lights on). I checked the plug with a meter and there was no juice. I checked the breakers and they are all fine. It turns out that all of the lights/plugs in the garage aren't working, but all the breakers are fine. :-( So for now we have an electrical cord connecting the refrigerator in the garage to the a plug in the kitchen and I can't charge the bike's battery any further (not that I think it needs it).

Sunday afternoon I went out for a ride after removing the windshield. Went to WalMart to fill up on gas, then drove back around the neighborhood a bit, and then decided I was up for a little faster/longer ride. So I rode out to Main St, turned left and drove. Fifteen miles later, a few stop signs and a few twisties I stopped (somewhere past Hurley, MO), turned around and headed back. Awesome little ride all in all. I did have one scary turn (mostly because it was at slow speed ~ 10 Mph) and a crazy woman in a GIANT SIZED SUV who thought that 60 miles an hour in a 55 was too slow. So, she passed me (very closely) and drove off at 85 Mph. I know it was 85 Mph because I gave her a bunch of room and then matched her speed for a second. 85 is pretty scary on the bike.

Here is a pic of the bike (I have some polishing to do).
