If you use a bunch of OS X apps that don't normally ever need to be alt-tab'ed to you should take a look at the utility called <a href="http://www.proteron.com/liteswitchx/">LiteSwitch X</a>. It replaced the standard alt-tab of OS X with a somewhat smarter one. LiteSwitch X allows you to hide programs from the alt-tab display so you don't have to end up alt-tabbing over programs like quicksilver, isync, etc.
