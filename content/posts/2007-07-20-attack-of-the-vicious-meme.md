The Vicious Meme was shot at me by the <a href="http://atomicbaboon.net/entry/107/">Atomic Baboon</a>. It's hard to avoid something when a nuclear powered Baboon shoots it at you. I mean, what are you going to do? Duck? The initial blast alone incinerates everything within a 50 mile radius. Not having a bunker like the Baboon, I was powerless to escape.

So here it is:
<ul>
	<li><p>I do not see silent black helicopters, but I know they exist. They are not what conspiracy theorists believe they are. No, Mr. Baboon. No, <a href="http://divebarreview.blogspot.com/2007/07/vicious-meme.html">Mr. Drinker</a>. You are wrong. Sadly, I cannot tell you who operates them or for what purpose. That information would cause everyone who reads this to be killed within minutes of reading it. My conscience could not bear that.</p></li>
	<li><p>I was captured by the police. I was taken "downtown". I was charged with "<a href="http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/criminal/charges/eluding1.pdf">Eluding an Officer</a>". I had in fact pulled over, was passed by the police car, waited a few minutes, got gas at the gas station I had pulled over in front of, got back in the car and continued down the block, towards the police station, before being pulled over by no less than 4 cop cars, 4 blocks from the police station.</p></li>
	<li><p>Gay black men used to try and pick me up in clubs.</p></li>
	<li><p>I have 2 kids now and understand why some parents snap and beat their children. Not that I would, I just understand. And yes, people that do need therapy and some jail time.</p></li>
	<li><p>I've often wondered: How much wood could a wood chuck chuck if a wood chuck could chuck wood?</p></li>
	<li><p>I voted for G. W. Bush once.</p></li>
	<li><p>I am scared for my kids and their future. The world is spiraling out of control. Extremism, Religion and Belief are to blame IMO.</p></li>
	<li><p>I miss my friends Charlie Zamloot, Jesse Harden &amp; Jim Jewett. I sometimes cry about it when I'm alone. Charlie was one of the best computer people I've known, he died too young. Jesse was even younger, a marine and survived a tour in Iraq. Only to be killed in a car wreck by someone on crack running from the police. Jim was a crotchety old man, but didn't deserve to die with a brain tumor. I miss you all and want you back.</p></li>
</ul>
