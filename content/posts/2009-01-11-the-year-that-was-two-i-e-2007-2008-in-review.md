title: The Year That Was Two (i.e. 2007/2008 in review)

So, for me last year was really 2008 &amp; 2007. I never really took the time to slow down at the end of 2007 and reflect on the year. I just ended up rolling right into 2008.

At the time I was building clusters for Engine Yard, among other duties. That combined with a new baby and crazy travel schedule made for very little time during the holiday season for anything but a brief visit with my mothers on x-mas day to open presents with the kids and have breakfast.

So long story short, the last year, for me at least, was really two years. Two very mixed years.

<strong>Pros</strong>
<ul>
	<li>
<a href="http://interlix.com">Interlix</a> was going strong.</li>
	<li>I started working for <a href="http://engineyard.com">Engine Yard</a> in June of 2007 as a contractor.</li>
	<li>
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=8147&amp;id=1053960861#/photo.php?pid=157961&amp;id=1053960861">Mia</a> was born on July 3rd, 2007.</li>
	<li>I got my current bike, a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/reqs.php#/photo.php?pid=222404&amp;id=1053960861">Triump Sprint ST</a>, after successfully selling my Victory on eBay.</li>
	<li>Geekerz was still around.</li>
	<li>I played <a href="http://eve-online.com">EVE</a> occasionally, at least until I started working for EY and I pulled myself out of Geekerz.</li>
	<li>With <a href="http://engineyard.com">Engine Yard</a>'s help, I moved to Sacramento, CA, escaping Missouri after a little more than 6 years there.</li>
	<li>I <a href="http://www.facebook.com/reqs.php#/album.php?aid=11669&amp;id=1053960861">rode my motorcycle</a> out to CA from MO.</li>
	<li>New house in Sacramento, CA. With a hot tub.</li>
	<li>Got to see my extended family at my mother's funeral.</li>
	<li>Met tons of interesting people by way of Engine Yard.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Cons</strong>
<ul>
	<li>My mother died of complications due to brain cancer.</li>
	<li>Vapor (aka Daniel Feather) died in a motorcycle accident.</li>
	<li>Joey died of complications due to cancer.</li>
	<li>I moved to Sacramento, CA, not the bay area.</li>
	<li>Still have my house in Republic, MO</li>
	<li>Couldn't sell <a href="http://interlix.com">Interlix</a>, ended up closing it down.</li>
	<li>Not much time for family given my work schedule. But that's the life of working for a startup.</li>
	<li>Paying my brothers rent.</li>
</ul>
If I think of anymore I'll update the post.

What were your pros and cons of 2008?
