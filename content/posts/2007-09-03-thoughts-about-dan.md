title: Thoughts about Dan

I haven't had the heart to write anything about the death of my friend <a href="http://vapor.org">Dan</a>. So I've decided to just occasionally write down some "Thoughts about Dan".
<ul>
	<li>Dan Feather was my best friend. I didn't really realize that until after he died. After family members he was the person that I talked to most, shared my thoughts with most, spent the most time with, etc.</li>
</ul>

More, later I ... well can't write anymore now.
