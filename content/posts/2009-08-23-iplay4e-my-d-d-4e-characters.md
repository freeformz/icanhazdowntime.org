If you play D&amp;D with a computer or iPhone and haven't found out about <a href="http://http://iplay4e.appspot.com/">iplay4e</a>, go there now. It's a great "little" Google App Engine app that helps your run your character.

Here are links to my 2 characters, one of which I haven't played yet.

Ooth'talo (Genasi Sword Mage) -Â <a href="http://iplay4e.appspot.com/characters/viewSheet?xsl=fullpage&amp;key=agdpcGxheTRlchELEglDaGFyYWN0ZXIYp58NDA">Full Screen</a> - <a href="http://iplay4e.appspot.com/characters/viewSheet?xsl=jPint&amp;key=agdpcGxheTRlchELEglDaGFyYWN0ZXIYp58NDA">iPhone</a>

Zidius (Eladrin Wizard) - <a href="http://iplay4e.appspot.com/characters/viewSheet?xsl=fullpage&amp;key=agdpcGxheTRlchELEglDaGFyYWN0ZXIYs5QPDA">Full Screen</a> - <a href="http://iplay4e.appspot.com/characters/viewSheet?xsl=jPint&amp;key=agdpcGxheTRlchELEglDaGFyYWN0ZXIYs5QPDA">iPhone</a>

I've been playing Ooth for most of the summer and I just rolled up Zidius yesterday.
