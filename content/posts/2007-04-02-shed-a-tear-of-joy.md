A little excerpt from the EMI/Apple Announcement today:

Times: Are you giving the greenlight for people to share unprotected tracks?

Eric (EMI CEO) : We have to trust consumers. Some will choose to steal is inevitable. Doesnâ€™t diminish our commitment to fighting piracy. At the same time, the key is to giving consumers the best possible experience. To trust them, to educate them. That way well grow sales rather than diminish them.

Thank you, thank you, thank you. It seems that 1 big music company sorta kinda gets it.

I'm not thrilled with the $.30 premium, but the new unencumbered tracks will also be encoded at 256K.
