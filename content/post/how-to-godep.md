I often see people confused about how to use [Godep][godep] inside of their projects and I want to share how *I* use it.

## Getting Started

You've written some code that relies on external dependencies. You want your users to be able to compile the project with as little hassle as possible. You want to ensure that they get the same versions of the dependencies that you yourself are using. Godep does that.
