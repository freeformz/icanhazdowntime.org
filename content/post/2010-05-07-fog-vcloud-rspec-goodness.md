Maybe full classes eventually. Structs are a happy <br />medium for now. <p /> Mostly testing though. <p /> 50 examples, 0 failures <p /> That reminds me ... <p /> If you use rspec ... at all ... Go look at these presentations and absorb. <p /> <a href="http://pure-rspec-rubynation.heroku.com/">http://pure-rspec-rubynation.heroku.com/</a> <p /> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/gsterndale/straight-up-rspec">http://www.slideshare.net/gsterndale/straight-up-rspec</a> <p /> They're awesome. <p /> Trust me. <p /> Thanks to technicalpickles on #rspec for pointing me at them.
