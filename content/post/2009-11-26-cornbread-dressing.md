This is a "dressing" recipe my mother used to make all the time for Thanksgiving (and sometimes on X-Mas).

I'm currently in the process of re-constructing it from my mothers notes, which aren't exactly "accurate", since she made it from memory all the time.

Hope you like it.
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
	<li>3 Boxes of Jiffy Cornbread Muffin Mix</li>
	<li>3 Red (or Green) Bell Peppers</li>
	<li>1 Small can of mushrooms</li>
	<li>1 Medium Yellow Onion</li>
	<li>4 Celery Stalks</li>
	<li>4 Slices of White (or Whole Wheat) Bread, Toasted</li>
	<li>3 Cans of Chicken Broth</li>
	<li>1 Cup Milk</li>
	<li>1/4 lb. of Butter, Melted</li>
	<li>Salt to taste</li>
	<li>Pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
Prepare Jiffy Cornbread Muffin Mix as per box. 3 boxes can go into one 9.5" x 11" pan for 20-25 minutes @ 400°F . Cool for 30-60 min after it's done.

Preheat oven to 375°F

In a food processor, combine the bell peppers, mushrooms, yellow onion &amp; celery stalks. Process until fine. Empty into mixing bowl.

Crumble the toast and the cooled cornbread into the vegetable mixture. Stir to combine.

Add in 2 cans of chicken broth, milk, butter and stir to combine. Stir in enough of the 3rd can of chicken broth to get the right consistency (puddingish).

Add salt &amp; pepper to taste.

Pour into oblong 13"x9"x2" pan. Bake for 40-60 minutes @ 375°F.
