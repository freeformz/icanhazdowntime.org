<p>I think it's time we import US Federal Law into a git repo. Congress members and Senators can fork/branch for bills. President can merge once a commit hash is properly digitally signed (i.e. has enough votes). Anyone could check it out, review history. Smart politicians would make their forks/branches publicly available. We could host the entire thing on github (okay, maybe not).</p>
