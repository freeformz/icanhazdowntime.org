<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,243221,00.html">North Korea to get giant rabbits to boost meat production</a>.

In the <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0533466/">words of Anya</a> ...

<em></em><em>Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposes,
They've got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses.
And what's with all the carrots-?
What do they need such good eyesight for anywa - y?
Bunnies, bunnies it must be bunnies!</em><em>
</em>
So beware North Korea ... You may have gotten more than you bargained for.

Or maybe that's our <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601101&amp;sid=at6M14HLun1w&amp;refer=japan">plan</a>....
