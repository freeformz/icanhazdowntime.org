I've drunk the cool-aid.

Last week I got my 15" Mac Book Pro and it's a really awesome machine. OS X is really nice and all the apps pretty much just work. Took a little getting used to at first, but I've more or less got the feel of it. Still getting confused with what is effectively 5 meta keys (Apple/Alt/Ctrl/Fn/Shift) a bunch, but time will solve that. Plus I get BSD under the hood, so I can install all my favorite (and necessary) tools for <a href="http://interlix.com/">work</a> via <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">Fink</a>.
Some software that I've found useful so far (aside from FireFox):
<ul>
	<li>
<a href="http://www.neooffice.org/">NeoOffice</a> (OpenOffice done "right" for the Mac ... Hopefully it doesn't stall a real native OpenOffice for Mac ... not the X windows based OpenOffice for OSX mind you)</li>
	<li>
<a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a> - For playing media that quicktime doesn't like.</li>
	<li>
<a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> - "Programmers" editor. (Not Free)</li>
	<li>
<a href="http://www.codeweavers.com/products/cxmac/">CrossOver Mac</a> - So I can play EVE under OS X :-)  (Not Free)</li>
	<li>
<a href="http://plorn.org/www.adiumx.com">Adium</a> - Nicer in some ways than iChat ... less so in others</li>
	<li>
<a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a> - Just a great utility that does so much. If you don't like reaching for the trackpad or a mouse download it and try it.</li>
	<li>
<a href="http://www.manytricks.com/witch/">Witch</a> - Ctrl+Tab through all of your open windows</li>
	<li>
<a href="http://growl.info/">Growl</a> - Bubble alerts for various apps.</li>
</ul>
Since I sometimes need to run an actual MS Windows environment I ordred a copy of <a href="http://www.parallels.com/en/products/desktop/">Parrallels</a>  (should be here later today .. dunno why I didn't just download it). I'll need to find my copy of Windows XP Home to install.
If you know of any other cool/useful/fun/etc OSX Software please let me know.

Now ... All I need to get is a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">Mac Mini</a> (<a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/">or</a> <a href="http://www.apple.com/macpro/">better</a>), an <a href="http://www.apple.com/appletv/">Apple TV</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/airportextreme/">Airport Extreme</a> &amp; of course an <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a> ... :-)
Must Needs Live the iLife. :-)
