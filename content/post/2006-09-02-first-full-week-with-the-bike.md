So I completed the first full week with my bike. I drove it about 300 miles total. I like the bike, but I really do want something a little newer. My main reasons being:
<ol>
	<li>My bike has only 4 gears. I'd like one with 5. Mainly for highway driving.</li>
	<li>The clutch on my bike is a little "catchy".</li>
	<li>I'd like something with a little longer wheelbase, mine is a little short.</li>
</ol>
If I can't adjust the position of the rear brake/shifter forward an inch or two, then that can be added to the list as well. I just got the Clymer manual for the bike, so we'll see. My legs are too damn long.

But other than that it's a nice bike and it's been pretty fun driving it so far.
