I’ve had the pleasure of working with several other gophers the last few months on a prototype dependency management tool named [dep](http://github.com/golang/dep).

`dep` is part of the project started [last year](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/go-package-management/YD8d5MtOf8g/LjqwWfXnBwAJ) and is organized by [Peter Bourgon](https://peter.bourgon.org/). I was asked to join the team working on this project due to my involvement in a different tool, [godep](https://github.com/tools/godep), the OG dependency management tool for Go, (inherited from [Keith Rarick](https://github.com/kr)) and my work at [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) serving our customers who use Go.

The other members of the team, aside from myself and Peter, are [Jessie Frazelle](https://twitter.com/jessfraz), [Andrew Gerrand](https://twitter.com/enneff) and [Sam Boyer](https://twitter.com/sdboyer). Andrew is part of the Go team @ Google. Jessie works at Google and is involved in large Go projects such as [Docker](https://github.com/docker/docker/commits?author=jessfraz) and [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/commits?author=jessfraz). Sam wrote and maintains [gps](https://github.com/sdboyer/gps), the constraint solver powering `dep`.

The team has [published](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/go-package-management/VF_3It_DMwU/4ie8mmVEBQAJ) a bunch of [info](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/go-package-management/et1qFUjrkP4/Jp0T7l3uBAAJ) about our progress over the course of our work. To date, various other tool authors and concerned parties have also been involved in different ways.

**NOTE**: `dep` is pre-alpha, so anything below may or may not be true moments after this blog post is published. However, I will try to keep it up-to-date as development continues.

### In the beginning…
Let’s take dep for a drive and pretend we’re writing a web application using github.com/gorilla/mux. Here is some pretend code to get us started:

{{< gist freeformz e9619fa1010eaaf5a0532c6d36d68f2c >}}*`$GOPATH/src/github.com/freeformz/depExample/main.go`*

The first thing to do after writing some code, or when using `dep` for the first time on an existing project is to run `dep init`.

`dep init` adds the current version of any of the project’s dependencies found in `$GOPATH` to the `manifest.json` file. Because I have `github.com/gorilla/mux` in my `$GOPATH`, the `manifest.json` file includes it. I recently ran `go get -u github.com/gorilla/mux`, so the version of `github.com/gorilla/mux` in my `$GOPATH` is at master. If the version in my `$GOPATH` matched a [Semver](http://semver.org/) compatible tag (ex: `v1.2.3`), that tag’s name would have been used instead.

`dep` works across architectures and go versions. Using `github.com/gorilla/mux` with older versions of Go (< 1.7.0) pulls in the `github.com/gorilla/context` package. When I last ran `go get -u github.com/gorilla/mux` I was running Go 1.7.5 so the `github.com/gorilla/context` package is NOT in my `$GOPATH`. Because this could be a dependency necessary to compile the project, it is included in the `lock.json` file. In situations like these, if a dependent project has a semver compatible release tag, `dep` chooses the latest release. In this case that is [`v1.1`](https://github.com/gorilla/context/releases/tag/v1.1) of `github.com/gorilla/context`.

Because `github.com/gorilla/mux` does not include a `manifest.json` file `dep` don’t know if `github.com/gorilla/mux` currently works with `github.com/gorilla/context` @ `v1.1`. Barring an override (see below), `dep` honors the constraints found in dependencies’ `manifest.json` files.

`dep init` includes all dependencies, analyzed recursively and the exact versions being used in the `lock.json` file.

For the [example app](https://github.com/freeformz/depExample/commit/b13054dd0a332e22a392951c5eb19b4e59453cca), this creates the following two files:

{{< gist freeformz acd74404768083d373dc10d06d514b89 >}}
*`lock.json and manifest.json`*

### Ensuring the project can build
After `dep init` is run, `dep ensure` [should be run](https://github.com/freeformz/depExample/commit/259b580183b3698593a0aa89072f5e5b7838e646) to populate the `vendor/` directory with a copy of packages required to build your project. This ensures that any of your project’s dependencies are included in the lock file and vendor directory. Any time you want to ensure that you have all of your dependencies recorded, run `dep ensure`.

### Adding another dependency
You don’t have to do anything up front to add another dependency, just start using it in your code. When it’s time to check in your work though you need to run `dep ensure` to update the `lock.json` file and `vendor/`. This will lock the project to the latest released version of each dependency.

In the sample app I added a [sub package](https://github.com/freeformz/depExample/commit/fa297a98fa5256b63404671494ecfca557a60d1b) `math` that can be used to add, subtract or retrieve a named value and a HTTPHandler that can be used in `main.go`. After writing that code a `dep ensure` run produced [these changes](https://github.com/freeformz/depExample/commit/8c67df68b24be375eb0082f54810251ad46c61b1) to the `lock.json` file and the `vendor/` directory.

### But what if the latest doesn’t work for me?
If you need to specify a version, you can use the alternate form of the `ensure` command like so: `dep ensure github.com/gorilla/mux@^1.3.0`. That command modifies the `manifest.json` file, constraining `dep` to use `^v1.3.0` of `github.com/gorilla/mux`, resolves the dependency tree and updates the dependencies in `vendor/` to reflect any differences resulting from the change. On the example application, that looks like [this](https://github.com/freeformz/depExample/commit/00efe026ef7b56138d798d3696a4b679b7d5da6f) because `dep` has already chosen the latest available version, `1.3.0`. Future updates (`dep ensure -update`) however will no longer track the master branch and instead use semver tagged releases ≥ 1.3.0 and < 2.0.0.

`dep` mostly uses Rust’s `cargo` [operators](http://doc.crates.io/specifying-dependencies.html) for selecting versions of dependencies. These include `^`, `~` and `=`. To have a more restrictive, forward compatible match than `^` use `~`. For example `dep ensure github.com/com/gorilla/mux@~1.2.0` will match any version ≥ 1.2.0 and < 1.3.0. To lock to a specific version use the `=` prefix (e.x. `dep ensure github.com/com/gorilla/mux@=1.2.0`). In the [future it’s planned](https://github.com/golang/dep/issues/225) that `dep` will default to `^` when no prefix is specified.

### Keeping current
To keep a project’s dependencies up to date use `dep ensure -update`, which updates all dependencies to the latest versions allowed by the constraints in `manifest.json`, ignoring the contents of `lock.json`. New versions are written to `vendor/` and the appropriate meta data updated in `lock.json`.

In [the future](https://github.com/golang/dep/issues/202) it should be possible to `dep ensure -update` a single dependency.

### Status
When a dependency is missing, `dep status` tells you which project and which packages contained inside are missing. For instance, here is what `dep status` shows after [this commit](https://github.com/freeformz/depExample/commit/c719d1ca8dddaf72e104e0207b767e26c415e0c5) to the example app:

{{< gist freeformz a8b9293c16b78019cadf098323cd3154 >}}

When the project’s `lock.json` is up-to-date, the `dep status` command shows you a list of all dependencies, as projects, and for each:

* the constraint(s) applied
* the selected version
* the selected revision
* the latest version or revision available
* the number of packages used

After adding bolt to the sample project and running [`dep ensure`](https://github.com/freeformz/depExample/commit/8c67df68b24be375eb0082f54810251ad46c61b1) to update `lock.json` and `vendor/`, `dep status` looks like this:

{{< gist freeformz 448f3242846c2282f847c521cab0f280 >}}

These two modes may be combined [in the future](https://github.com/golang/dep/issues/161).

### Removal
`dep remove <dep>` removes the dependency from `manifest.json`, `lock.json` and `vendor/`, once it’s no longer used. Using the example app [this commit](https://github.com/freeformz/depExample/commit/665a611a18e0f91aeac61ab74fe4340f2414a991) removes the usage of `github.com/gorilla/mux` from the application and the [next commit](https://github.com/freeformz/depExample/commit/86119a49150ded092ea8e271eb9517d5a4affcb5) is the result of `dep remove github.com/gorilla/mux`. Because `github.com/gorilla/mux` is removed, `github.com/gorilla/context` is no longer needed and is also removed. If a dependency is still being used when `dep remove` is run, the command will fail. Removal can be forced with the `-force` flag, which results in the constraint being removed from `manifest.json`. However, since the dependency is still in use it's still listed in `lock.json` and copied into `vendor/`.

### In the future….
We’re still in an experimental phase with `dep`, there are many [issues](https://github.com/golang/dep/issues) open and much work to do still. I hope this post clearly showed you some examples of how the tool is expected to be used. This usage [may change](https://github.com/golang/dep/issues/213) over time via community feedback and [pull requests](https://github.com/golang/dep/pulls). If you have some spare cycles and are interested in working on some Go tooling please drop by `#vendor` on [gopher slack](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/) and pick up an issue or two to work on.

Thanks for reading!
